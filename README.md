PROBLEM STATEMENT
      ZuriMart  is a leading e-commerce retailer specializing in consumer goods across multiple  regions. However, the management has noticed increasing challenges in demand forecasting and inventory management.
 Some products frequently run out of stock,

leading to lost sales and frustrated customers. Meanwhile, other products

remain unsold for extended periods, tying up capital

and increasing storage costs.

Additionally, delayed supplier deliveries

have led to customer dissatisfaction, causing them to switch to competitors.



  To address these issues, ZuriMart's management has requested the analytics team to

generate a real-time dashboard and data-driven insights that will

help optimize supply chain efficiency and sales performance.
